Recipe Management CRUD Application This project is a complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application for managing recipes, built using Node.js, Express.js, and Mongoose (MongoDB). The application follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture and includes RESTful API endpoints to handle various recipe-related operations.

Features Create Recipe: Add new recipes to the database. Retrieve Recipes: Fetch all recipes or a specific recipe by its ID. Update Recipe: Modify the details of an existing recipe. Delete Recipe: Remove a recipe from the database.

Error Handling: Handles errors gracefully with proper status codes and messages. API Documentation: All endpoints are documented and tested using Postman.

Tech Stack Node.js: JavaScript runtime for server-side execution. Express.js: Framework for building RESTful APIs. Mongoose: ODM for MongoDB to manage schema and data. MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing recipes. Postman: API client used for testing and documenting API endpoints. Installation and Setup
