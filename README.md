**Recipe Management CRUD Application**
This project is a complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application for managing recipes, built using Node.js, Express.js, and Mongoose (MongoDB). The application follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture and includes RESTful API endpoints to handle various recipe-related operations.

**Features**
Create Recipe: Add new recipes to the database.
Retrieve Recipes: Fetch all recipes or a specific recipe by its ID.
Update Recipe: Modify the details of an existing recipe.
Delete Recipe: Remove a recipe from the database.


**Error Handling**: Handles errors gracefully with proper status codes and messages.
**API Documentation**: All endpoints are documented and tested using Postman.


**Tech Stack**
Node.js: JavaScript runtime for server-side execution.
Express.js: Framework for building RESTful APIs.
Mongoose: ODM for MongoDB to manage schema and data.
MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing recipes.
Postman: API client used for testing and documenting API endpoints.
